0,US,"This tremendous 100% varietal wine hails from Oakville and was aged over three years in oak. Juicy red-cherry fruit and a compelling hint of caramel greet the palate, framed by elegant, fine tannins and a subtle minty tone in the background. Balanced and rewarding from start to finish, it has years ahead of it to develop further nuance. Enjoy 2022–2030.",Martha's Vineyard,96,235.0,California,Napa Valley,Napa,Cabernet Sauvignon,Heitz
1,Spain,"Ripe aromas of fig, blackberry and cassis are softened and sweetened by a slathering of oaky chocolate and vanilla. This is full, layered, intense and cushioned on the palate, with rich flavors of chocolaty black fruits and baking spices. A toasty, everlasting finish is heady but ideally balanced. Drink through 2023.",Carodorum Selección Especial Reserva,96,110.0,Northern Spain,Toro,,Tinta de Toro,Bodega Carmen Rodríguez
2,US,"Mac Watson honors the memory of a wine once made by his mother in this tremendously delicious, balanced and complex botrytised white. Dark gold in color, it layers toasted hazelnut, pear compote and orange peel flavors, reveling in the succulence of its 122 g/L of residual sugar.",Special Selected Late Harvest,96,90.0,California,Knights Valley,Sonoma,Sauvignon Blanc,Macauley
